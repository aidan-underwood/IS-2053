# Purpose: To get introduced to Spyder (our IDE - Integrated
#          Development Environment) and to our programming
#          language Python.  Elementary features will 
#          include how to print to the console and see
#          usage of variables.
# 
# Programmer: Aidan Underwood


# going to print three lines
print("Hello world!")
print("Hope you will enjoy programming!")
print("Programming can be fun!")
print()
# going to use a variable now
# and print its contents
strHello = "Hello world again"
print(strHello)
print()
# now for some numeric variables and printing
# out their contents
num1 = 5
num2 = 9.4
print(str(num1) + " " + str(num2))
# print out the data types of these variables
print(str(type(num1)) + " " + str(type(num2)))
# change the data type of one of our variables
num3 = int(9.4)
print(num3)
# print message to end program
print("Goodbye")
