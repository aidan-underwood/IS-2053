# Purpose: To get introduced to Spyder (our IDE - Integrated
#          Development Environment) and to our programming
#          language Python.  Elementary features will 
#          include how to print to the console and see
#          usage of variables.
# 
# Programmer: Aidan Underwood


# going to print three lines
print("Hello world!")
print("Hope you will enjoy programming!")
print("Programming can be fun!")
print()
# going to use a variable now
# and print its contents
strHello = "Hello world again"
print(strHello)
print()
# now for some numeric variables and printing
# out their contents
age = 25
money = 123.75
name = "Johnny"
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Money in pocket: $", money)
print()
# print out the data types of these variables
print(type(age))
print(type(money))
print(type(name))
print()
# change the data type of one of our variables
age = "pokeman"
print("age:", age)
print(type(age))
print()
# print message to end program
print("This program was written by Aidan Underwood")
